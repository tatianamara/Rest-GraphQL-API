# RestApi_Project

This rest api was created during the Complete guide of NodeJS by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller

It's a api of an online shop that includes checkout and payment functionalities.

During this course, I could learn how to work with Files, use MVC Pattern, use Node.js with SQL, Sequelize, NoSQL, and Mongoose. 

I also learned about session and cookies, how to make user authentication and authorization, and how to handling payments with Stripe.js.  

How to run the project?
After cloning the project, access it via your terminal and run the commands:

`npm install`  
`npm start`
