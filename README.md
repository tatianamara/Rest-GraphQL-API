# Rest Api Project

This REST/GraphQL api was created during the Complete guide of NodeJS by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.  

It is an api to be used together with a blog's front-end application: https://github.com/tatianamara/frontend-starting-setup  

During this course, I could learn how to build REST APIs and also GraphQL APIs, how to make authentication, file upload and so much more.  

## How to run the project?
After cloning the project, access it via your terminal and run the commands:

`npm install`  
`npm start`
